# Zomato-Data-Analysis

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment
of different types of restaurants at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru
being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from cuisines from all over the world.
With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn't been saturated yet and the demand is increasing
day by day. With such an overwhelming demand for restaurants, it has therefore become important to study the demography
of a location which I did using geospatial analysis.

The data is accurate to that available on the Zomato website until 15 March,2019.
